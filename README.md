## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require combindma/redirector
```
The package will automatically register itself.

Next you must register the `Combindma\Redirector\RedirectsMissingPages`-middleware:
```php
//app/Http/Kernel.php

protected $middleware = [
       ...
       \Combindma\Redirector\RedirectsMissingPages::class,
    ],
```

You must publish and run the migrations with:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Combindma\Redirector\RedirectorServiceProvider" --tag="redirector-migrations"
php artisan migrate
```

You can publish the config file with:
```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Combindma\Redirector\RedirectorServiceProvider" --tag="redirector-config"
```

This is the contents of the published config file:

```php
return [
    /*
     * This is the class responsible for providing the URLs which must be redirected.
     * The only requirement for the redirector is that it needs to implement the
     * `Spatie\MissingPageRedirector\Redirector\Redirector`-interface
     */
    'redirector' => \Combindma\Redirector\UrlsRedirector::class,

    /*
     * By default the package will only redirect 404s. If you want to redirect on other
     * response codes, just add them to the array. Leave the array empty to redirect
     * always no matter what the response code.
     */
    'redirect_status_codes' => [
        \Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\Response::HTTP_NOT_FOUND,
    ],

    /*
     * When using the `ConfigurationRedirector` you can specify the redirects in this array.
     * You can use Laravel's route parameters here.
     */
    'redirects' => [
        //        '/non-existing-page' => '/existing-page',
        //        '/old-blog/{url}' => '/new-blog/{url}',
    ],
];
```
